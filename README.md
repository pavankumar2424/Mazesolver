# Maze Solver

A GUI application which will show a maze and the user can specify the target point and then the application will show the user a path from starting point to target point.

The application provides two path options for user to choose. Based on the user's selection either the shortest path or the longest path will appear on the maze.

Used Java Swing and AWT to build the GUI of the application.


## How to use it

This application provides two buttons for shortest path and longest path. Once you click either of these buttons the curresponding path will appear on the maze.

You can use the Clear button to clear the path on the maze so that you set a new target point. Inorder to set a new target point you must clear the path. You can click any point in the maze to set a new target point.
